 * - keychainService: pinned to a stable name so reads and writes always hit
 *   the same partition. Without this, SecureStore derives a service name from
 *   the bundle that can drift between Classic and EAS builds, causing reads
 *   to miss writes from a previous build.
 * - keychainAccessible: AFTER_FIRST_UNLOCK_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY allows the auth
 *   token to be read on every cold launch after the device has been unlocked
 *   once since boot. The default (WHEN_UNLOCKED) refuses access during the
 *   first-unlock window, which is the most common TestFlight failure mode.
 * - requireAuthentication: false keeps SecureStore on its non-biometric code
 *   path, so it never reads NSFaceIDUsageDescription or constructs a
 *   biometry-current-set access control object — both of which can throw
 *   NSException and trip iOS 26's unhandled async-void TurboModule rethrow.
